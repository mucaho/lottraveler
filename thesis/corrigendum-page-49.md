# Properly discern complexity classes for specific types of NLPs

The paragraph states how a fixed evaluation order can be found for positive and tight logic programs.
The paragraph should state how a fixed evaluation order can be found for positive and stratified logic programs, instead.
The polynomial time complexity thus applies to those two types of NLPs.
